<h1>Text classification using NLP / Core engine of a chat bot.</h1>
Human language is astoundingly complex and diverse. When we write, we often misspell or abbreviate words, or omit punctuation. There is a lot of unstructured data around us. Natural language processing helps computers communicate with humans in their own language and scales other language-related tasks. For example, NLP makes it possible for computers to read text, interpret it, measure sentiment and determine which parts are important. Understanding this will enable you to build the core component of any conversational chatbot. This is the core engine of a conversational chatbot

Detecting patterns is a central part of Natural Language Processing. Words ending in -ed tend to be past tense verbs. Frequent use of will is indicative of news text (3). These observable patterns — word structure and word frequency — happen to correlate with particular aspects of meaning, such as tense and topic. But how did we know where to start looking, which aspects of form to associate with which aspects of meaning? In this series we shall learn to create the core engine of a chat bot. We will learn text classification using the techniques of natural language processing.
